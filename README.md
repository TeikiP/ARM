# acquisition_reconstruction

QT :
The project has been developed for Qt 5.7.1, with the usage of Qt Creator 4.2.0. Some of the
functions and rendering methods used might not work properly under other versions.

The project is compiled by calling the following qmake command "qmake ARM.pro -spec linux-g++-64 
&& /usr/bin/make qmake_all" from within the source folder ("./ARM") before make is called.

HOTKEYS :
 - Escape will close the window,
 - L will let you load a new model file,
 - P will switch the display to a point cloud,
 - T and C will switch the display to cubes made of triangles,
 - the arrow keys will allow you to rotate the model,
 - holding left click also allows to rotate the model,
 - holding right click will translate the model along the X and Y axes,
 - the scroll wheel can be used to zoom in or out.
